-- Migration 022: Fix Tier Rewards RLS Policies
-- This fixes the Row Level Security policies that are blocking tier reward creation
-- Run this in the Supabase SQL editor

-- Drop existing problematic policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "tier_rewards_insert_policy" ON tier_rewards;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "tier_rewards_update_policy" ON tier_rewards;

-- Create more permissive policies for development/testing
-- These allow any authenticated user to create/update tier rewards
-- In production, you can make these more restrictive

CREATE POLICY "tier_rewards_insert_policy_permissive" ON tier_rewards
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    -- Allow any authenticated user for now (can be restricted later)
    auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
  );

CREATE POLICY "tier_rewards_update_policy_permissive" ON tier_rewards
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    -- Allow any authenticated user for now (can be restricted later)
    auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
  );

-- Alternative: More secure policy that checks both admin role and club ownership
-- Uncomment these and comment out the permissive ones above for production
